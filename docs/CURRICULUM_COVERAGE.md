# Curriculum coverage

This is a count of rows in the database this script was pointed at. It is not a
statement that Forge covers an engineering degree, a university syllabus,
or a placement season. Subjects that are absent are simply absent — this report
does not list planned or imagined ones.

Regenerate it with `python scripts/coverage_report.py --write docs/CURRICULUM_COVERAGE.md`
after seeding a development database. Do not treat a committed snapshot as live
production content unless you just generated it from that database.

## Coding sheets by stream

Each row is one branch category. A sheet is reachable from a stream when it
is written for everyone or names that category; the problem count is the
distinct bank problems those sheets reach, so a problem in two sheets is
counted once.

| Stream | Sheets | Problems reachable |
|---|---:|---:|
| Computer Science & IT | 12 | 87 |
| Electronics & Electrical | 12 | 90 |
| Mechanical & Manufacturing | 11 | 84 |
| Civil & Infrastructure | 10 | 75 |
| Chemical & Materials | 12 | 90 |
| Bio & Other Engineering | 11 | 83 |

A stream with no sheet of its own still gets the sheets written for every
branch - the pattern sheets and the interview set - so a learner is never left
with an empty page.

## Programming paths

Each path progresses through Foundations, Working Practice and Advanced Engineering. A stage with modules but no checkpoint, or a capstone column that is empty, is a gap - not a variant.

A branch with a handful of subjects is a sample, not a semester. Core learning
stays free. Certificates issued by this application are not university degrees
and must not be described as accredited.
