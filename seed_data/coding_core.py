"""Core interview problem bank (spec §16-§18): arrays through dynamic programming.

Grouped by the pattern each problem teaches, which is how the sheets in
``coding_sheets.py`` present them. Every problem here is language-independent
content - statement, examples, hints, editorial, one Python entry point and its
tests - built with the helper in ``coding_common.py``.

Only Python stubs are shipped for this bank. That is a deliberate choice rather
than an omission: the Python driver in ``engineverse/drivers.py`` is the one the
judge can compose and this repository can verify end to end (see
``scripts/check_problems.py``), and shipping a Java stub whose harness has never
been run would be offering a language that does not work.

The statements are written to be readable *inside* EngineVerse: no problem tells
the learner to go and look something up on another site, and each editorial
explains the pattern well enough to stand alone.
