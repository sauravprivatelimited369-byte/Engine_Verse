"""Stream problem bank: the problems that make the sheets fit a branch.

A mechanical learner and a cyber-security learner should not be handed the same
sheet list. The core bank in ``coding_core.py`` teaches patterns every software
interview asks about; this module is the other half - computation that arises
*inside* a discipline, written so that it is still real programming practice and
still judged the same way.

The mapping from branch to sheet lives in ``engineverse.hub.STREAM_SHEETS`` and
the sheets themselves in ``coding_sheets.py``; nothing here knows which branch
reads it, which keeps the content in one place and the routing in another.

Every problem here is still a Python function with test cases, so the judge, the
editor, XP and the mistake notebook all work exactly as they do for the core
bank. "Engineering computing" is not a lesser tier of the platform - it is a
different set of inputs.
