"""Problems for the book-depth language paths: raw drills plus pattern gaps.

The language books in ``language_book_*.py`` end every module with a judged
problem to code. Most of those already exist in ``coding_core``,
``coding_streams`` and ``practice_data``; this module holds the ones that did
not:

* six ``drill-*`` problems: raw basics (loops, conditions, scans, string
  validation) that the C# foundations modules - and any true beginner - solve
  before touching patterns;
* ``merge-intervals`` and ``trapping-rain-water``: two pattern staples the
  stage plans reference that the bank was missing;
* ``word-ladder`` and ``serialize-tree``: hard favourites named across the
  mastery modules, now actually solvable instead of merely mentioned.

Same contract as the other banks: one Python entry point per problem, built
with the helper in ``coding_common.py``, verified by
``scripts/check_problems.py``.
