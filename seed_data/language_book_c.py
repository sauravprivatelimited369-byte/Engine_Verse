"""Book-depth C modules: memory, pointers, algorithms and interview mastery.

C is where abstractions end: every list is a malloc, every string a buffer
with a length you track, every "reference" a pointer you can print. This
book teaches algorithms the C way — array decay, manual stacks, linked
structures from malloc, qsort/bsearch, hash tables from scratch, trees,
graphs, DP and bit tricks — plus a method module for systems-flavoured
interviews. Compile everything with -Wall -Wextra; run tests under
AddressSanitizer.

            """**Why this matters.** C gives you the machine with no padding,
so complexity analysis here is physical: an `O(n²)` scan thrashes cache,
a malloc per element fragments the heap, a `strlen` in a loop condition
re-scans every iteration (the classic quadratic nobody sees). Learn to
count both steps and bytes — C interviews grade both.

**Growth first.** `O(1)` indexing, `O(log n)` halving, `O(n)` scans,
`O(n log n)` qsort, `O(n²)` pairs. Analyse loops, then price the calls
inside: `strlen` is `O(n)` (call once, store it), `strcat` in a loop is
quadratic (track the end pointer), `memmove` of k bytes is `O(k)`,
`qsort` averages `O(n log n)`. State space too: auxiliary arrays are
`O(n)`, in-place with a few indices is `O(1)`, recursion depth d is
`O(d)` stack — and C stacks are small (8MB typical; deep recursion
segfaults where Java throws).

**Memory is the second complexity.** Every malloc has metadata and
fragmentation cost; per-node malloc for a million nodes is slow and
wasteful versus a single arena/pool. Realloc doubling amortises growth
like C++ vectors — implement it once to believe it. `sizeof` is your
friend: `n * sizeof *p` (not `sizeof(int)` — types change, the
dereference does not). Count peak live bytes, not just big-O.

**Cache: the hidden constant.** Sequential array access is ~10x faster
than pointer-chasing a linked list at scale — same Big-O, different
universe. Interviews rarely demand cache analysis, but "arrays beat
lists for scans" said once, correctly, marks you as someone who has
measured.

**Common mistakes.** `strlen` in loop conditions; `strcat` chains;
recursion depth on long inputs; claiming `O(1)` while mallocing per
call; ignoring `const` (it documents and enables optimisation);
measuring -O0 and concluding C is slow (always -O2 for timings).

**Interview angle.** Open with time and peak space, naming allocations:
"O(n) time, O(1) besides the output — no mallocs in the loop." That
sentence is the C interview in miniature.""",

in `'\\0'` — with no length attached. Every overflow, truncation and
read-past-end in history lives here. Master bounded functions, explicit
lengths and in-place two-pointer patterns, and you master the most
dangerous corner of the language.

**The rules.** A string of n chars needs n+1 bytes. `strlen` counts
before the NUL (`O(n)` — hoist it). `strcpy/strcat/sprintf` are
unbounded: prefer `snprintf(dst, sizeof dst, ...)`, `strncpy` with
manual NUL (it does not always terminate — set `dst[size-1] = 0`
yourself), `strncat`, `memcpy/memmove` with explicit lengths.
`strcmp/strncmp` compare; `strchr/strstr` search; `strtok` mutates and
keeps static state (not reentrant — `strtok_r` or hand-rolled parsing).
Read with `fgets` (bounded) or `getline` (allocates), never `gets`
(removed from the language for cause).

**Lengths travel with buffers.** Professional C passes `(char *buf,
size_t cap)` everywhere and returns status, not strings. `snprintf`'s
return (would-have-written length) detects truncation: `if ((size_t)rc
>= cap) truncated`. This discipline — length as data — prevents the
entire overflow class.

**Text patterns.** Palindrome: indices from both ends, skipping
non-alnum via `isalnum`/`tolower` from `<ctype.h>` (pass `unsigned
char` — negative char values are UB in ctype). Anagram over `a-z`:
`int count[26]`. In-place reverse/rotate with swaps. Parsing: walk with
a pointer, `strtol` with endptr checks (never `atoi` — no errors).

**Common mistakes.** EngineVersetting +1 for NUL; `strncpy` without manual
termination; `sizeof(ptr)` instead of buffer size after decay; ctype
with plain char; `strcat` loops (quadratic); comparing with `==`
(pointer comparison — use strcmp).

**Interview angle.** Every string solution should name its bounds:
"output needs n+1; I snprintf into cap." Then the algorithm. Safety
first, pointers second — that order is the senior signal.""",

compile-time length that evaporates the moment you pass them to a
function ("decay" to pointer). Every in-place algorithm — dedup,
partition, rotate, merge — depends on understanding exactly what an
array parameter is and is not.

**Decay and sizeof.** `int a[10]` in the defining scope: `sizeof a` is
`10 * sizeof(int)`. Passed to `f(int *p)`, it is a pointer: `sizeof p`
is 8. Consequence: always pass the length (`f(a, n)`), and compute
counts at the definition site (`sizeof a / sizeof a[0]`). `int a[n]`
(VLA) exists in C99 (optional in C11+) — fine for small scratch, never
for untrusted n (stack overflow). `static int a[N]` for fixed tables.

**In-place technique.** Read/write pointers with the invariant "before
write: final". Remove-duplicates-sorted, move-zeroes, remove-element:
one pass, `O(1)` space. Partition (Lomuto/Hoare) underlies quicksort
and quickselect. Rotation by reversal. Merge-two-sorted from the end
when the buffer has tail space (avoids overwrite). Two pointers inward
for pair sums on sorted data. State the invariant aloud — it is the
proof and the grade.

**Multidimensional.** `int m[R][C]` is contiguous row-major; `m[i][j]`
is `*(m + i*C + j)`. Pass as `f(size_t r, size_t c, int m[r][c])` (C99
VLA parameters) or flatten with explicit indexing. `int **` is NOT a 2D
array (scattered rows) — know the difference cold; interviews probe it.

**Common mistakes.** sizeof after decay; off-by-one on last valid index
(n-1, not n); `a[i]` with signed/unsigned mixups (use size_t, compare
carefully); returning stack arrays (dangling — malloc or caller buffer);
`memcpy` on overlap (use memmove).

call pushes a frame (return address, saved registers, locals) onto a
small stack. Seeing recursion as stack discipline explains base cases,
depth limits, tail calls and why iteration often wins. Trees, DFS and
divide-and-conquer all live here.

**Frames and progress.** A call allocates a frame; return frees it.
Depth d with frame size f uses ~d·f bytes; default stacks (~8MB) hold
roughly 10⁵–10⁶ small frames — deep linear recursion (linked-list
length via recursion on 10⁶ nodes) segfaults. Every recursion needs:
base case(s) that return without recursing, and progress shrinking
toward them on every path. No progress = stack overflow, the C name for
infinite recursion.

**Where recursion fits.** Tree walks (depth = height; fine balanced),
divide-and-conquer (depth log n; mergesort/quicksort), backtracking
(depth = choices; N-Queens with an explicit board), DFS on small graphs.
Where it does not: long linear chains (iterate), hot loops (call
overhead + no cache benefit), untrusted depth (attacker-controlled
nesting → crash; cap depth explicitly).

**Tail calls and optimization.** A call in tail position *may* be
compiled to a jump (-O2, simple shapes) — but C does not guarantee TCO,
so never rely on it for correctness. Write iterative for depth you
cannot bound; keep recursion for naturally shallow structure (log n,
small trees).

**Memoization in C.** Arrays with sentinel init (`-1` = uncomputed),
or hash tables for sparse states. Fibonacci: naive `O(φⁿ)` calls →
`O(n)` with memo. State the table size as space. `static` memo inside
functions persists across calls (document it; not thread-safe).

**Common mistakes.** Missing base case; progress on only some paths;
stack-allocated giant locals per frame (huge frames = shallow limit);
recursing on untrusted depth; forgetting `return` on the recursive
path (garbage return, warning you ignored — use -Wall).

O(h) stack; O(n) worst skewed." Offer the explicit-stack iterative

`qsort` — with a comparator you write, and searching is `bsearch` or
your own loop. Interviews test whether you can wield both: order data
to unlock two pointers/merging, then binary search for boundaries.
Comparator bugs and midpoint overflow are the classic C traps.

**qsort.** `qsort(base, n, sizeof *base, cmp)` with `int cmp(const void
*a, const void *b)`. Cast inside: `int x = *(const int *)a;` then
`return (x > y) - (x < y);` — never `return x - y` (overflow). Average
`O(n log n)`, worst `O(n²)` (glibc uses mergesort fallback for large —
know your libc). Not stable. For structs, compare field by field. `qsort_r`
(GNU/BSD, differing signatures — portability wart) passes context.

**bsearch and hand-rolled.** `bsearch(&key, base, n, size, cmp)` needs
sorted data and the same comparator — returns pointer or NULL. But most
interview variants (first/last occurrence, rotated, sqrt, "smallest
feasible") need custom loops: invariant "answer in [lo, hi] if any",
`mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2` (overflow-safe — `(lo+hi)/2` overflows near
INT_MAX, the famous bug), strict shrinking, unsigned care (`hi = mid -
1` underflows at 0 with size_t — use signed or half-open ranges).

**Search on the answer.** "Minimum x with feasible(x)" where feasibility
is monotone: koko bananas, ship capacity, split-array-largest-sum.
Binary search the value range, greedy-check each mid. Recognising
monotonicity is the whole trick — state it explicitly.

**Common mistakes.** Comparator overflow; comparator inconsistency
(must be strict weak ordering — qsort misbehaves otherwise); bsearch on
unsorted; size_t underflow in `hi = mid - 1`; forgetting `sizeof *base`;
assuming stability.

safety. For binary search, state the invariant and the termination

That pain teaches ownership — who allocates, who frees, who owns the
`.next` — the core systems skill. Interviews test rewiring discipline
plus leak-free code (run under ASan/Valgrind to prove it).

**Build and free.** `Node *n = malloc(sizeof *n); if (!n) die();`
(check every malloc). Insert after p: `n->next = p->next; p->next = n;`
(new node first). Free whole list iteratively (recursion depth = length
→ stack risk). Ownership rule: the list owns its nodes; functions either
borrow (print, find) or take/return ownership (push returns new head or
takes `Node **head`). Document which.

**The three tricks.** *Dummy/sentinel* (`Node dummy = {0, head}`) kills
head-change special cases; return `dummy.next`. *Fast/slow*: meet iff
cycle (`==` on pointers); slow at middle when fast ends. *Reversal*:
`prev/cur/nxt`, `O(1)` space. Merge-two-sorted with dummy tail reusing
nodes. Partition around x with two dummy chains joined.

**Doubly-linked and intrusive.** Prev pointers enable `O(1)` delete
given the node. Real systems use intrusive lists (node embedded in the
struct, `container_of`) — mention awareness; interviews rarely demand
it. For LRU, hash + doubly-linked is the expected design (hash in C:
see next module).

**Common mistakes.** Lost `.next` (save first); use-after-free (free
then touch); double free; leaking on early return (one cleanup path);
cyclic test lists leaking by design (break cycle first); `free` without

from arrays (with capacity!) and queues from ring buffers or linked

next-greater and level traversals are the payoffs.

**Array stack.** `int buf[CAP]; size_t top;` push checks `top < CAP`
(overflow is an error, not growth — or realloc-double for dynamic).
Pop checks `top > 0`. All `O(1)`. Valid parentheses: push openers,
match closers, empty at end. RPN evaluation: numbers push, operators
pop-apply-push. Min-stack: parallel min array or packed pairs.

**Ring-buffer queue.** `buf[CAP]; head, tail, count;` indices modulo
CAP; full when `count == CAP`, empty when 0. `O(1)` both ends, no
shifts, no per-item malloc — the embedded default. BFS uses it (or a
growable deque) for level order: seed, pop-front, push-back unvisited.

**Monotonic stack.** Indices with decreasing values answer next-greater
for all in `O(n)`: while current beats stack top, pop and record.
Temperatures, stock spans, largest rectangle (with width accounting).

            """**Why this matters.** C has no dict — you build hashing from
arrays, pointers and a hash function. Doing so once teaches what
`O(1) average` really means (good distribution + load control), and the
patterns (complement, frequency, seen) solve dozens of interview
problems. Even when interviews allow "assume a hash map", having built
one shows depth.

**Design.** Array of buckets, size power of two (mask instead of modulo:
`h & (cap - 1)`). Hash strings with FNV-1a or djb2 (short, good
avalanche); hash ints with splitmix/finalizer (identity hashes cluster).
Collision strategy: *chaining* (linked lists per bucket — simple, no
probe logic, malloc per entry) or *open addressing* (linear probing in
the array — cache friendly, needs tombstones for delete). Load factor >
0.7 → double and rehash. These four decisions are the whole design
space — state them in interviews.

**Minimal chaining table.** Buckets `Node **table`; put: hash, find-or-
prepend; get: hash, walk chain with `strcmp`; delete: unlink + free.
`O(1)` average when chains stay short; `O(n)` worst adversarial. Free
walks every bucket (write `table_free` carefully — leaks hide here).

**The patterns (same as everywhere).** Complement (two sum: need =
target - x in table?), frequency (count then decide), seen (visited
set for repeats/cycles). Fixed alphabets: skip hashing, use `int[26]`/
`int[128]` — faster and simpler, a beloved follow-up.

**Common mistakes.** Bad hash (identity on clustered keys); no rehash
(chains grow → O(n) silently); modulo on power-of-two with weak low
bits (mask needs good low bits — finalizer!); freeing keys you do not
own (strdup on insert, free on delete — pick a rule); `==` on strings
in chains (strcmp!).

**Interview angle.** "I'll assume a hash map — chaining, FNV, rehash at
0.7" shows you know what you are assuming. If asked to build it, the
skeleton above plus careful free is the pass. Mention worst-case
adversarial input once, then move on.""",

free (postorder — children before parents, or you leak). Heaps are
arrays with index arithmetic. Both appear in systems interviews: BSTs
for ordered data, heaps for top-k and schedulers, tries for prefixes.
Pointer + array thinking combined.

**Binary trees.** `typedef struct T { int v; struct T *l, *r; } T;`
Insert/search/delete `O(h)`. Traversals: inorder (sorted for BST),
preorder (copy/serialize), postorder (free safely, heights), level
order (queue — see stacks module). Max depth: `1 + max(l, r)`. BST
validate with (min, max) bounds threaded down (local checks are wrong).
Free: postorder, every node, NULL after (in parent). No GC — draw who
frees what.

**Heaps in arrays.** `a[0]` min; children of i at `2i+1, 2i+2`; parent
at `(i-1)/2`. Push: append + sift up. Pop: swap root/last, shrink, sift
down. `O(log n)` both; heapify `O(n)`. Top-k via size-k heap (`O(n log
k)`); kth largest; merge-k-sorted with a heap of heads. Implement once
with a `Heap { int *d; size_t n, cap; }` + doubling — then you own it.

**Tries (bonus, high value).** Array-of-26 (or map) children + end flag;
insert/search/prefix in `O(L)` key length. Autocomplete, word break
pruning, IP routing. Malloc per node is fine for interviews; pools for
production. Mention it when "prefix" appears — interviewers light up.

**Common mistakes.** EngineVersetting free (leak every node); use-after-free
in delete-restructure; recursion depth on skewed trees (balance or
iterate); heap index arithmetic off-by-one (0- vs 1-based — pick one,
prove parent/child); BST delete's two-child case (successor swap, then
delete successor — practice it).

for networks, maps and dependencies.

**Representations.** Matrix: `int adj[V][V]` or bitset — dense graphs,
Floyd-Warshall, small V. Lists: `int *nbr[V]` with counts (or linked) —
sparse graphs, `O(V+E)` traversal. Grids: the grid IS the graph;
neighbours computed `(r±1, c±1)` with bounds checks; visited via
separate `bool` array or in-place mark (mutating input needs caller
consent). Edge lists for union-find/Kruskal.

**BFS/DFS.** BFS with ring queue: shortest unweighted paths, level
order, multi-source (enqueue all sources at 0 — rotting oranges).
DFS recursive (depth risk on big grids — `rows*cols` frames worst!) or
explicit stack: connectivity, islands, cycle detect (colours
white/grey/black; grey revisit = back edge), topo order (finish-time
descending). Both `O(V+E)`; grids `O(R·C)`.

**Topo and union-find.** Kahn's: indegree array + zero-queue + peel;
processed < V ⟺ cycle. Union-find: parent/rank arrays, find with path
halving, union by rank — near `O(1)`; components, redundant edges,
Kruskal MST. Implement union-find from memory — it is 30 lines and
endlessly useful.

**Common mistakes.** DFS recursion on huge grids (stack overflow —
iterate); no visited (exponential/cycles); directed vs undirected edge
insertion; matrix for sparse graphs (memory blowup); forgetting
disconnected components (outer loop over all V); in-place grid marks
when caller needs the grid.

turf: flags, masks, XOR cancellation, power-of-two checks. Together
they cover optimization problems and the "clever C" questions (single
number, counting bits, missing number) that interviews love.

**DP in C.** 1D: `dp[n+1]` with `dp[0]` base, fill ascending (stairs,
robber, coin change). 2D: `dp[r+1][c+1]` row-major (unique paths, edit
distance, LCS). Subset-sum boolean tables. Space cuts: rolling rows/
variables when transitions look back fixed distance (robber → two
ints). `malloc` tables sized `(n+1)`, init sentinels (`-1`/INF), free
after. VLA for small trusted n only. State time as "states × transition
cost", space as "live table".

**Bitwise core.** `& | ^ ~ << >>`. Masks: test bit `x & (1u << k)`;
set `x |= ...`; clear `x &= ~...`; toggle `^=`. XOR cancels (`a ^ a =
0`, `a ^ 0 = a`) → single number, missing number (`xor 0..n ^ xor
array`). `x & (x-1)` clears lowest set bit → popcount loop, power-of-two
check (`x && !(x & (x-1))`). Shifts: left into sign / overshift / negative
shift are UB — use unsigned, guard widths. `uint32_t` + `<stdint.h>`
everywhere.

**Bits as structures.** Bitset membership for small universes (26
letters in one `uint32_t`); state compression in DP (TSP/bitmask);
Bloom-filter intuition (k hashes into m bits). Gray codes, Hamming
distance (`__builtin_popcount(x ^ y)`), reversals — know the builtins
(`__builtin_popcount/clz/ctz`) and their UB edges (zero input!).

**Common mistakes.** Signed shifts/overflow (UB — unsigned!); `1 << 31`
on 32-bit int (UB — `1u`/`1ul`); `~` precedence surprises (parenthesize);
DP base/init errors (empty prefix!); fill order reading garbage; int
overflow in counting (use long/unsigned long, state bounds).

bounds (every index proven < length), and verification (warnings clean,
sanitizers silent). The five-step method adapts: each step gains a
systems question. Master it and you interview as an engineer, not a
coder.

**The five steps, C-flavoured.** (1) Clarify + contract: examples,
ranges, NULL/empty validity, ownership ("caller-provided buffer or
malloc inside?"), failure policy (return code vs sentinel). Write the
signature with `const` and sizes first. (2) Brute force with time AND
peak bytes + allocation count. (3) Optimise by pattern (hash→build or
assume-and-state; two pointers; window; stack; BFS/DFS; heap; DP;
binary search on answer) — and re-check bounds per pattern. (4) Code
defensively: NULL checks, size checks, `snprintf`, checked malloc,
`size_t` discipline, no recursion on untrusted depth. (5) Verify: trace
examples + NULL/empty/single/max by hand, then compile `-Wall -Wextra
-Werror -fsanitize=address,undefined` and run. Sanitizer-clean is the
C equivalent of "all tests pass" — say the command.

**The atlas (C triggers).** Inner search → hash (build chaining, or
`int[128]` for bytes). Sorted pairs → two pointers. Constrained
subarray → window with counts. Nested → bounded stack. Levels/shortest
→ ring-queue BFS. Connectivity/order → DFS/topo/union-find. k-extreme
→ array heap. Counting/optimum → DP table + space cut. Boundary → binary
search with overflow-safe mid. Bits → XOR/masks first.

**Behave senior.** `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` always; `const` on inputs;
`sizeof *p` not `sizeof(type)`; `restrict` where true (mention, do not
abuse); `assert` for impossible states (documents + debuggable);
valgrind/ASan/UBSan as routine, not rescue; `errno`/`perror` on syscall
failure.

ignoring malloc failure; `int` for sizes (overflow — size_t); recursion
on attacker depth; "works on my machine" without sanitizers; silent
coding (narrate bounds!).
