"""Flashcards for the 55 subjects that had none.

The seeded library started with 34 cards covering 18 subjects, which meant a
learner who opened Revision from, say, "Power Electronics" or "Surveying" found
nothing to revise. These fill the gap so every subject has cards.

They are deliberately written as recall prompts rather than definitions to
copy. The `hint` field is the nudge that gets you to the answer without giving
it away, because a card you can only answer by reading it is not a card.

Difficulty follows the SM-2 schedule in `engineverse/srs.py`: `easy` cards are
meant to be answered in a couple of seconds, `hard` ones require reconstructing
a derivation or a chain of reasoning.
