"""Per-topic diagrams for EngineVerse notes.

Every entry here is a *scene* for `engineverse.diagrams`, not markup: a list of
primitives with numbers and plain strings. `diagrams.render()` validates it and
rebuilds the SVG, so nothing in this file can inject script and a malformed
entry raises at seed time instead of drawing a half-diagram.

Each topic gets one diagram chosen to answer the question a student actually
asks first, with two to four hotspots that expand the part worth explaining.
The six hand-written diagrams that shipped earlier are replaced by these so
every topic uses one code path.

Canvas is 640 wide. Height varies with what is being drawn.
