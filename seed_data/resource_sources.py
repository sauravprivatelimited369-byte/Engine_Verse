"""The resource library: curated sources, expanded to cover every subject.

Before this module existed, 53 of the 73 seeded subjects had no video, book or
resource at all, and 55 had no flashcards. A learner who opened "Hydraulics" or
"Compiler Design" found an empty shelf.

The design constraint is honesty. A dead link is worse than no link, and a deep
link to one specific lecture rots within a semester — so the URLs here are kept
to host roots, official documentation indexes and search endpoints, all of
which are stable on a timescale of years rather than weeks. Where a subject
genuinely needs "find me a course on this", the resource *is* a search over a
trusted catalogue, and the description says so rather than pretending to be a
curated lecture.

That trade buys two things: the URL surface stays small enough to actually
check, and `scripts/check_links.py` can verify every one of them in a single
run. CI runs it, so a link that dies fails the build instead of quietly
becoming a dead button.

URLs are grouped so a reader can see at a glance what each entry is:

    OFFICIAL     language, database and standards documentation
    TOOLS        simulators, calculators, visualisers
    TEXTBOOKS    open-access textbooks and course material
    CATALOGUES   places to go looking for a course on a subject

# Additional sources.
#
# Added because most subjects were reaching only one book and two videos: the
# discipline maps below had one entry per category, so 67 of 73 subjects had
# fewer than three books and 53 had fewer than three videos. Every subject now
# gets at least three of each.
#
# Everything here is legally free to read or embed. Open-access textbooks
# (OpenStax, LibreTexts, and author-hosted texts released for free) and public
# lecture channels - no pirated copies of commercial books.
