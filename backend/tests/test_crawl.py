"""Crawls every reachable page and fails on a broken one.

Individual route tests assert on one page each. This walks the whole site as a
signed-in user - every topic, subject, project, language and library page - and
fails if anything 404s, returns 5xx, or writes an ``app.error`` audit row. It
exists because a template that renders for the fixture data and crashes on the
twelfth topic is indistinguishable from a working one until something walks all
twelve.

403 is allowed and deliberately so: the crawl runs as a student, and
``/admin`` returning 403 is the authorisation working, not a broken page.
