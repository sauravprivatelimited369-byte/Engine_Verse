"""The seed corpus has to be complete and internally consistent.

These exist because of a specific class of bug: every seeder resolves a subject
or topic key with ``dict.get()`` and skips on a miss, so a reference to something
that was never created simply disappears. Four rows keyed to a
``probability-statistics`` subject went that way, along with eleven roadmap steps
pointing at topics that do not exist and nine that named a ``resource`` ref type
no seeder handled. Each one reported success while quietly dropping content, and
twenty-one roadmap steps rendered as text with nothing to click.

So the assertions here are about *absence*: nothing referenced may be missing,
and nothing may be silently dropped on the way in.
