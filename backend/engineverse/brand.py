"""Configurable branding (spec §1).

The product name, tagline and accent colours live in the ``site_config`` table,
so a white-label deployment is a data change rather than a code change.

Key names here must match three places at once: the seeded rows in
``seed_data/library_data.py::SITE_CONFIG``, the ``{{ brand.* }}`` references in
``backend/templates/``, and the admin settings form. They previously drifted
apart (``brand_name``/``accent`` here vs ``site_name``/``accent_color`` in the
seed vs ``brand.site_name`` in the templates), which silently rendered an empty
product name on every page because an unknown key returns an empty string.
