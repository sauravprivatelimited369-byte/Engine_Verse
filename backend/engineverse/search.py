"""Universal search (spec §8).

Backed by SQLite FTS5 (porter stemming + unicode folding) with bm25 column
weighting so titles outrank body text. Queries degrade gracefully:

  1. AND of prefix-expanded tokens  -> precise
  2. OR  of prefix-expanded tokens  -> recall
  3. LIKE substring scan            -> fallback
  4. Levenshtein "did you mean"     -> typo correction

The generated Postgres schema (db/postgres/schema.pg.sql) gives search_index the
same columns plus a stored ``tsvector`` with a GIN index, so the *data* migrates
unchanged. The SQL below does not: ``MATCH`` and ``bm25()`` are FTS5-only, so a
Postgres deployment needs a ``tsquery``/``ts_rank`` branch in ``search()`` before
this module will run there. Page code is unaffected either way.
