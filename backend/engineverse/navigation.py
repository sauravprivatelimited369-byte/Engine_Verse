"""The site's information architecture, written down once.

EngineVerse grew to roughly sixty pages. The navigation that pointed at them was
written out three separate times - the desktop top bar, the five footer columns
and the mobile bottom bar - and each copy was edited on its own. They drifted:

* the top bar said ``Practice`` and the footer heading said ``Practise``;
* the top bar said ``Code`` for ``/programming`` while the footer said
  ``Learn to code`` for the same URL, next to a *different* item called ``Learn``;
* the mobile bar lit up ``My stream`` while the reader was on ``/explore`` or
  ``/subjects/...``, and lit up ``Sheets`` while they were on ``/projects``;
* about fifteen pages (``/mistakes``, ``/streaks``, ``/today``, ``/leaderboard``,
  ``/onboarding``, ``/install``, ``/videos``, ``/books``, ``/dpp/archive``) were
  reachable only from the footer, so a reader who never scrolled that far could
  not find them at all;
* ``/sitemap.xml`` carried its own list of twenty paths and had quietly fallen
  behind the application - it omitted ``/sheets``, a top-bar item, and every
  sheet slug with it.

Nothing enforced agreement because nothing was shared. This module is the shared
thing: one ordered table of every destination on the site, grouped the way a
learner actually thinks about it. The top bar, the mobile menu, the footer, the
breadcrumb trail, the "everything on EngineVerse" index, the sitemap and the
GitHub Pages export list are all *rendered from this table*, so a page added here
appears in all of them and a page missing here is missing from all of them. When
the site and its navigation disagree, this file is the one place to look.

Deliberately dumb on purpose. It is plain data with no database access and no
request object, so ``scripts/export_pages.py`` can import it at build time and
the test suite can assert on it without an application running. Anything that
comes from the database - the counts on the index page - is filled in by the
caller; this module only knows the shape of the site.

    hierarchy. The labels disagreed as well: /branches/x said "Branches" and
    /subjects/y said "Subjects" while both pointed at /explore.

    The trail is Home, then the owning group, then the owning destination, then
    the item itself. A level is dropped when it would repeat the URL of the level
    above it, so /topics/arrays reads "Home > Learn > Arrays" rather than
    "Home > Learn > Explore subjects > Arrays" with two links to the same page.

    ``leaf`` is the name of the item on this page, supplied by the handler that
    already fetched it. Without one, the trail stops at its last link and the
    page's own heading is the current level.

    ``parents`` inserts extra ``(label, url)`` levels immediately above the leaf,
    for the one relationship the flat table cannot express: a topic belongs to a
    subject as well as to the catalogue, so /topics/arrays asks its handler for
    the subject in between. Everything else is derivable and needs no argument.

    ``signed_in`` matters because a trail is made of links. For a signed-out
    reader the group level resolves to that group's public landing page, and a
