# Changelog

Notable changes to EngineVerse. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions are not yet
tagged, so everything below is listed under **Unreleased** until the first
release.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Native Android app** (`android/`): Kotlin and Jetpack Compose with a native
  home screen, an offline subject catalogue (93 subjects and 406 topics, bundled
  from the seed data by `scripts/export_android_catalog.py`), a study planner,
  progress with streaks, settings, a splash screen and a hardened in-app viewer
  for full notes and the playground. It includes JVM unit tests.
- **Android app workflow**: unit tests, lint and a debug APK artifact on every
  Android change. A signed release APK is built only on manual dispatch, using
  repository secrets.
- **Study planner** (`/planner`): tasks, exam countdowns and a focus timer, kept
  in the browser, with JSON export and import.
- **Opportunities** (`/opportunities`): internships, scholarships, olympiads
  and hackathons, linked only to official pages. A weekly CI job checks them.
- **Help and feedback** (`/support`) and a `/api/me/export` download of your own
  data on the full website.
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue and pull
  request templates, `.editorconfig` and this changelog.
- `robots.txt` and a sitemap for the GitHub Pages copy.

### Changed

- **GitHub Pages copy**: progress lives in one device-local profile with
  export and import. Pages that only work with a server (sign-in, codes,
  password reset) are no longer exported; personal pages are `noindex`.
- The Pages workflow targets this repository. Tests, jsdom checks of the
  exported site, and checks of every bundled browser runtime gate the deploy.
- Repository URLs come from one place (`backend/engineverse/project.py`)
  instead of being hard-coded to the old repository.
- CI uses Node 22 and syntax-checks every browser script.
- The website's export buttons explain that saving files does not work inside
  the Android app, instead of reporting a download that did not happen.

### Removed

- The browser-side "accounts" on the Pages copy: fast password hashes,
  on-page six-digit codes and a GitHub token in browser storage.
- The public learner registry (`data/learners/registry.json`), its sync script,
  its workflow and the `/api/sync/*` routes. Learner data no longer goes into
  the public repository.
- The generated Java WebView APK builder (`scripts/build_android_apk.py`) and
  its workflow, replaced by the native app.
- `scripts/check_auth_flow.js`, which tested the removed browser accounts.

### Security

- No credentials of any kind are stored by the static site or the app. Imported
  progress files are validated field by field.
- The Android viewer loads only this site's HTTPS pages, exposes no JavaScript
  bridge, blocks mixed content and file access, and enables Safe Browsing.
